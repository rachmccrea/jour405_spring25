# Introduction

Multiple regression analysis is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. This analysis is particularly useful in journalism for exploring complex relationships in civic data, such as how different demographic and socioeconomic factors collectively impact voter turnout. By understanding these relationships, journalists can provide deeper insights into civic participation patterns and identify potential barriers to voting.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages('corrplot')
library(corrplot)
options(scipen = 999)
```

## Load the Data

The first step in our analysis is to load the data. Here we read the data from a CSV file, which contains information about voter turnout and various demographic factors across Maryland counties. This dataset will be used to build our model that will try to see which factors are most important in predicting voter turnout. The turnout percentage is from the 2024 general election.

```{r}
md_turnout <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_turnout.csv")
head(md_turnout)
```

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (5 points)

Before building our model, let's explore the data to understand the variables and their relationships. Examine the correlation matrix to see how the independent variables relate to each other and to the dependent variable (voter turnout). Which variables seem to be correlated? Are there any that are not correlated at all? Also look at the multiple scatterplots. Which variables seem to have a linear relationship with the dependent variable? Which do not?

The variables that affect turnout the most seem to be unemployment, race (pct_white), and age. Education level and population have less of an impact on voter turnout. It looks like the percentage of white voters, income, and education level aren't very correlated to each other, but percentage of white voters, employment, and population are. 
Looking at the scatterplots, I'd say pct_white, age and income have positive linear relationships to turnout. Unemployment and population have a negative linear relationship to turnout. Education definitely has less of a linear relationship, and there are a lot of outliers with income. 

```{r}
# Summary statistics
summary(md_turnout)

# Create correlation matrix
selected_vars <- md_turnout |> 
  select(turnout, population, income, pct_bachelors_higher, 
         pct_unemployed, median_age, pct_white)
correlation_matrix <- cor(selected_vars)
print(correlation_matrix)

# Visualize correlation matrix
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "circle")

# Create scatterplots
md_turnout |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c(population, income, pct_bachelors_higher, 
                       pct_unemployed, median_age, pct_white),
               names_to = "variable", 
               values_to = "value") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = turnout)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between predictors and voter turnout",
       y = "Voter turnout (%)")
```

## Task 2: Initial Model Evaluation (5 points)

Next, we construct an initial linear model to analyze how different factors influence voter turnout across Maryland counties. This model helps us quantify the relationships and assess which factors are significant predictors of turnout. 

### Residuals

The residuals of a model are the differences between observed values and the values predicted by the model. For this model:

* **Min and Max** values indicate the range of residuals. 
* **Median** value tells us if the model is generally centered around the actual data points.

### Coefficients

The coefficients tell us the estimated effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable:

* **Population**: Is the coefficient positive or negative? Is it statistically significant?
* **Income**: Does higher income correlate with higher turnout?
* **Education (pct_bachelors_higher)**: How does education level impact voter participation?
* **Unemployment**: Is there a relationship between unemployment and voter turnout?
* **Median Age**: Do counties with older populations have different turnout rates?
* **Race (pct_white)**: Is there a relationship between racial composition and turnout?

### Model Fit

* **Residual Standard Error**: How much does the model typically deviate from actual turnout?
* **Multiple R-squared**: What percentage of the variability in turnout is explained by the model?
* **Adjusted R-squared**: How well does the model fit after accounting for the number of variables?
* **F-statistic**: Is the model as a whole statistically significant?


Examine the output of the model, checking the coefficients, residuals, and overall model fit. How well does this multiple variable model predict turnout? Do any of the variables seem to be insignificant? Is this a useful model, based on what you've seen? Why?

It looks like the min and max are pretty small, so a small range of residuals. The median is also very small.
The variables with the highest coefficients (biggest impact on turnout) are income and population. Looks like higher income equals higher turnout, but higher population equals lower turnout. 
The adjusted R-squared says these values account for about 80% of the impact on turnout, which isn't bad, but could be higher. The p-value is very low, which is a good sign. 
```{r}
# Build initial model with all predictors
initial_model <- lm(turnout ~ population + income + pct_bachelors_higher + 
                   pct_unemployed + median_age + pct_white, data = md_turnout)
summary(initial_model)

```

## Task 3: Model Refinement (5 points)

Create three alternative models by adding or removing variables to see if we can improve the model's performance. Turnout will always be the dependent variable, but you should alter the independent variables by removing or adding some. Then compare the models using adjusted R-squared values. Are any of the models significantly better than the others?

For the first model, I only used the variables with the highest coefficients. That didn't work very well, since the adjusted R-squared dropped way down. 
Next up, I tried taking out population. That gave me a very low p-value and a slightly higher adjusted r-squared than Model 1. The residuals stayed fairly low, too. Feeling good about this one, but I bet I can make the adjusted r-squared higher. 
For the last one, I removed the education level because that variable seemed to have the smallest impact on turnout according to the initial data analysis. 

I think my final model, using income, unemployment rate, median age, and pct_white worked the best out of all four models. The adjusted r-squared says these account for about 82% of the impact on voter turnout, and the p-value was very small. This model had the highest coefficients out of all the ones I tried, and the residuals were fairly small, though they were a little larger than model 1. I feel pretty good about this model, though would like to see if there were other variables that could have an impact on turnout. 


```{r}
# Model 2
#removing variables with the lowest coefficients 
model2 <- lm(turnout ~ population + income + median_age, data = md_turnout)
summary(model2)

# Model 3
model3 <- lm(turnout ~  income + pct_bachelors_higher + 
                   pct_unemployed + median_age + pct_white, data = md_turnout)
summary(model3)

# Model 4
model4 <- lm(turnout ~ income + 
                   pct_unemployed + median_age + pct_white, data = md_turnout)
summary(model4)

# Compare models
cat("Model 1 (Full model) - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(initial_model)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 2 - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(model2)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 3 - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(model3)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 4 - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(model4)$adj.r.squared, "\n")

# Create comparison chart
model_names <- c("Full model", "Model 2", "Model 3", "Model 4")
adj_r_squared <- c(summary(initial_model)$adj.r.squared,
                   summary(model2)$adj.r.squared,
                   summary(model3)$adj.r.squared,
                   summary(model4)$adj.r.squared)

model_comparison <- data.frame(Model = model_names, Adjusted_R_squared = adj_r_squared)
ggplot(model_comparison, aes(x = reorder(Model, Adjusted_R_squared), y = Adjusted_R_squared)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Model Comparison by Adjusted R-squared",
       x = "Model")
```


## Task 4: Using the Model (3 points)

Without using the words "multiple regression model", describe how you could use this analysis to cover an election or voter participation story.

We could use this model to run predictions on voter turnout for every town in Maryland, then see how things go on election day. That would allow us to identify the towns where turnout was unusually high or low based on the demographics of the area. That could lead us to really interesting stories about what was impacting voter turnout in those places: was there an issue on the ballot that was important to the people in that town? Was there something else going on in the area that distracted residents from voting? There's a lot of potential with this model to identify patterns and deviations from predictions that could lead us to more stories.
